        <h3><em>Plant Life Cycles</em></h3>
        <p>Plants go through different life cycles based on how long they live, with three main categories: annuals, biennials, and perennials.</p> 
        <p>Annuals live for just one year, blooming continuously during the growing season before fading away. Biennials take two years to bloom, with the first year focused on growing leaves and stems, and the second year for flowering. Perennials, which last for several years, bloom for a few weeks or more each year, with timing varying across seasons.</p>

        <h3><em>Annuals</em></h3>
        <p>For example, annual plants complete their life cycle in a single year, usually blooming in summer and dying in fall. However, some types, like winter annuals, start growing in late summer or fall, stay dormant in winter, and resume growth in spring and summer. In colder areas, plants that seem like annuals might behave like perennials in warmer climates. This is important to know for plants such as pansies, ornamental kale, and dusty miller, which have different levels of toughness.</p>

        <h3><em>Biennials</em></h3>
        <p>Biennials need two years to complete their life cycle. They grow leaves and stems in the first year, then flower, produce seeds, and die in the second year. In places with harsh winters, they may need protection like cold frames to survive.</p>

        <h3><em>Perennials</em></h3>
        <p>Perennials are tough enough to survive winter and live longer than annuals and biennials. They can be herbaceous, meaning their above-ground parts die in winter but grow back in spring, or woody, keeping their above-ground parts alive year-round and growing from existing stems.</p>
